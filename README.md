# MapEditor_RA2
做一个没有UI的地图编辑器，先实现基本功能。
说明：全部代码来自zzattack和OPENRA的开源程序。本人只是对代码进行一个组合。

关于python程序：
需要先手动复制[isoMapPack5]下面的字符串到一个单独的txt中，再把程序中的txt路径改成这个txt，然后会把输出结果存到这个路径的另一个txt中，名称也在程序里改。

关于matlab程序：
是我读出来的rx、ry，用于研究地图的画点顺序。

关于Csharp程序：
请直接跳到末尾的main函数。如果想读取地图，直接把之前生成的那个txt中的字符串复制到某一行有好多字符串的地方。
至于想输出什么，就看你会不会用了。
